# Development Log – MCP Time-Traveler + Kiro

Built in December 2025 as a solo developer using Kiro as the primary IDE.

## Major Kiro Sessions

- Session 1: Generated the initial monorepo scaffold (apps/api, apps/web, mcp-server, shared/types)
- Session 2: Refined app-spec and mcp-spec, regenerated types and handlers
- Session 3: Implemented registry adapters for npm, PyPI, and RubyGems
- Session 4: Built the React Kiroween UI, including Haunted Mode
- Session 5: Wired up the MCP server and API integration
- Session 6: Deployment fixes for Heroku (API) and Vercel (web)

Kiro was active in all of these sessions for both code and documentation.
